# Autism Consortium Resource & Events Database

[Current site](http://www.autismconsortium.org/resources-and-events/database)
[Target design](https://www.1deg.org/)

* Will this be a microsite/redesign of a portion of the website or full site redesign/redevelop?
* Chris mentioned a porting over of a database from MySql toâ€¦MySql. What exactly needs to be done to the data from it's current state?
  * Is this something where we could export the data base and use as is?
  * Any new data to add to the db?
* What are the browser compatibility requirements?
* The exemplar design is image heavy. With that design, we need to be cognizant of image quantity/size on a single page.

## Back End
The back end work is the biggest black box right now. Not knowing what exactly has to be done with the data, building the server side logic, and ramping up with PHP are on my mind.

**Back End Work Estimate:** 40-80 hours

## Front End
Front end work is the most clear on what needs to be done. The design is (for the most part) a given and set. The largest task here is image selection. If Autism Consortium had a library of images to select from it would be ideal. This design will require **a lot** of images and image production, which can be automated by photoshop batches.

**Front End Work Estimate:** 20-30 hours
